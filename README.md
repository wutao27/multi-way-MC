* `hhead.m` is the function for computing the tensor \head{H}.
* `varian.m` is the function for computing the random walk variances of linear system x = Hx+b.
* `script.m` is the script code for various experimental tasks described in the paper. Task 1: compute the success ratio. Task 2: compute the speed up ratio.
